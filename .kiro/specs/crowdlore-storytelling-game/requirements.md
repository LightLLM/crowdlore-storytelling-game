# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CrowdLore is a community storytelling game built for Reddit's Developer Platform using Devvit Web. The system enables thousands of Redditors to collectively shape a fictional world by voting and commenting on daily moral or creative dilemmas. Each day presents a new "world decision" post where players discuss options, vote on outcomes, and witness how their collective choices evolve the story through summarized outcomes and ASCII visualizations.
